This project has been created as part of the 42 curriculum by aravelom.

## Description

NetPractice is a networking training project from the 42 curriculum.
Its goal is to help students understand fundamental networking concepts
through interactive exercises.  
The project focuses on IP addressing, subnet masks, routing, and how
devices communicate inside a network.

## Instructions

### Running the training interface
Open the `index.html` file in a web browser (such as Firefox or Chrome).

### Exporting configurations
For each level, complete the required network configuration and export
the configuration file using the export option provided in the interface.

### Submission requirements
You must export **10 configuration files** (one per level).
All exported files must be placed **at the root of the Git repository**
before submission.

## Resources
